Hackerspace Brussels - Space management scripts

This is the natural evolution of hsb-members.

The hsb-members script is taking over more roles and is progressively evolving
to a database application.

To reflect the evolution, the hsb-members will be progressively gutted from
functionalities, to become a simple frontend to the database.

Some new scripts will be written to add a web interface.

Because this application will manage a lot of practical things in the space,
it is like a concierge in a building, this is why it bear the same name.
