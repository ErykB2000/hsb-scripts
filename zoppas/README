Zoppas - Hackerspace Brussels fridge computer

This directory hold the files needed to build the system image and
the application(s) that run on the fridge

The kernel builder is a bunch of scripts used for my car computer, they need 
to be cleaned up so they can easily be repurposed for another application, 
that's why it's not included in the package yet.

The folder zoppasfs is the additional ramdisk image.
