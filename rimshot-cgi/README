The trolling page

This project started one evening after a couple of beers and too many bad jokes.
It got production ready about two hours later. (http://xkcd.com/323/)

This script is meant to be used as a CGI script for your web server 
(apache in our case), the script suppose you're using Pulseaudio: in that case,
you must add the user www-data (or whatever user your web server run at) to the
pulseaudio user (pulse-access) to get audio. Otherwise, just change the variable
PLAYPROG to the player of your choice. The variable DIR_AUDIOFILES must be set
to the directory holding the files you want to play. To add more buttons to the
page, just add more files to the directory.

KNOWN BUG: the script has issues with filenames containing a plus sign (+) and spaces.
