Shell scripts:
74ls673.sh        - Use a shift register on a Raspberry Pi connected to the GPIO
                    lines, Uses 3 lines, provides 16 outputs

74150.sh          - Read an input multiplexer. Read 16 inputs, uses 5 GPIO lines

74150+74673.sh    - Combination of the two: read 16 inputs, provides 12 outputs,
                    uses 4 GPIO lines

blackknight       - Init script to auto-start the black knight, based on debian skeletton

Installation
------------
No makefile yet. Install the Free Pascal compiler and it's runtime libraries,
# apt-get install fpc fp-units-misc fp-utils
then compile the program
# fpc blackknightio.pas
Copy it to final destination, set SUID bit mand make it owned by root
# cp blackknightio /usr/local/bin
# chmod +s /usr/local/bin/blackknightio
# chown root:root /usr/local/bin/blackknightio
Copy the init script to the system init directory
# cp blackknight /etc/init.d
