io - The I/O interface for the front door

This is the driver and the brain behind the front door controller, with some example scripts
Made for the Raspberry Pi

Shell scripts:
74ls673.sh        - Use a shift register on a Raspberry Pi connected to the GPIO
                    lines, Uses 3 lines, provides 16 outputs

74150.sh          - Read an input multiplexer. Read 16 inputs, uses 5 GPIO lines

74150+74673.sh    - Combination of the two: read 16 inputs, provides 12 outputs,
                    uses 4 GPIO lines
