Hackerspace Brussels - membership management scripts

Those are the scripts I use for member administration.
They are crude, half-assed, braindead, but they (barely) work.

Give it a try and enjoy.

The command mail(1) must be fully working and be able to send mail to the
outside world. Having a local SMTP relay is a good idea.

The scripts are being reworked to use a MySQL database. The .CSV is still the
recomended way to store the data. Don't rely on the Mysql bits, but have a 
database ready to be used. :-)
