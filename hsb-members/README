Hackerspace Brussels - membership management scripts

Those are the scripts I use for member administration.
They are crude, half-assed, braindead, but they (barely) work.

Give it a try and enjoy.

The command mail(1) must be fully working and be able to send mail to the
outside world. Having a local SMTP relay is a good idea.

You also need a working MySQL database with the commandline mysql client.

Create a dedicated database user and a database for the script and update the config
file to reflect your situation.
