mkknl - the kernel builder

This kernel builder take a config file and downloads the packages, unpack them,
compile them and cram everything into the built-in initramfs of the kernel.

You end up with a single file bootable system.


At the moment, the scripts are not very functional: the script was originaly 
written to rebuild the software of my car computer and was never intended for
any other use, a lot of stuff need to be rewritten.

Even non-functional, the script is included to give a glimpse of how i built 
the system for the fridge. It will be cleaned in the end.
